That ends things from this game. The second game is on the 10th of November at Gqeberha. We will be there to bring it to you. Do join us then. Until next time, don't forget to follow all the action live and the analyses on this website as we bring it to you. See you soon. Bye.
Suryakumar Yadav | India captain: [on India's record here at Durban, if he knew about it] Is it? I did not know about that, I just got to know now. We have not changed our brand of cricket in the last 3-4 series, very happy with the win. [on Samson] The amount of hard work he has put in over the last few years, doing the boring work, he is eating the fruits of that. He was in the 90s but still he was looking for a boundary, playing for the team which shows the character of the man and that's what we look for. [on getting the spinners in at a crucial stage] That was the plan, we were looking for the crucial wickets of Klaasen and Miller and the way they (spinners) delivered, it was incredible. [on if he is enjoying the captaincy] As I said already at the toss and the PC, boys have made my job easier, I don't need to carry any baggage, the way they have been showing that fearless attitude, the boys are enjoying themselves on and off the field, which makes my job easier. The brand of cricket we play, even though we lose a few wickets, we want to play without fear. It's a T20 game, we know we have 20 overs but if you can score 200 in 17 overs, why not.
Aiden Markram | South Africa captain: [if the toss decision of his played a part in hindsight] Not so much about the toss. Both new-balls did a bit with the extra bounce, it was consistent in the two innings. Once the newish ball wore out, it played well. We wanted to get off to a better start and that is where we lost the game. Sanju played incredibly well, put our bowlers under pressure, plans to negate him and better plans will help us going forward. Once he is striking like that, it's pretty hard to stop and you take your hat off to him. We had a couple of meetings today with who were bowling the death overs, incredibly proud with the two (Coetzee and Jansen) and a really big positive for us tonight. [on plans for the next game] From an individual point of view they will understand where they can get better and then meet as a batting and bowling group, you don't fix it in the nets, it's more about the approach and tactical point of view.
Sanju Samson | Player of the Match: Really enjoyed my time in the middle. Playing it well, maximum utilisation of my current form you can say. [on what is going right for him] The intent, we have been talking about being aggressive and keeping the team ahead of yourselves. Once you play three-four balls you are looking for the boundary, I'm not thinking much, sometimes it pays off, sometimes it doesn't, happy it worked out well today. [how important was it to start the series well?] It was very crucial, knowing the home advantage South Africa has, they are a gun side and it was important to start the series well. Happy that we started with a win.
Most T20I wins in a calendar year
29 Uganda in 2023 (Win% 87.9)
28 India in 2022 (70.0%)
22 India in 2024 (95.6) *
21 Tanzania in 2022 (72.4%)
20 Pakistan in 2020 (69.0%)
20:41 Local Time, 18:41 GMT, 00:11 IST: Comprehensive from India and they keep their good record at Durban intact. Arshdeep set the tone with the wicket of Markram in the first over and then the spinners took over. Both Bishnoi and Varun were superb as they built the pressure and shared 6 wickets among themselves. 8 overs for those 6 wickets for 53 runs and that's where the game was won. South Africa were not allowed to break free and one dangerous batter after the other fell. Coetzee used the long handle well before he was run-out and soon after Avesh Khan ended things by bowling Maharaj. The scorecard pressure was nicely built up by the Indians and apart from a few drops in the field, their bowling was in fine fettle. So India go 1-0 up. Stay tuned for the presentation...
